# Sensei (HackMIT 2015)
##### Team-members: Anshul Gupta, Jackie Luo, Piyali Mukherjee and Annie Zhang. 

##Overall App Idea
Can be claimed by either Anshul/Annie/Jackie

##Algorithm Design
Currently, we support a MATLAB desktop application which takes in a video file (.mp4) as input. 
We first create a foreground and background separator using MATLAB's ForegroundDetector (insert citation). Then, we establish Kalman filters to track the moving objects in the foreground using photometric distortions (more citations here). Finally, we render the input video and the output grayscale along parallel video players for users to see the results of the videos.
